This application does the following: 

- This game is a free-draw game of sorts,
- Free form canvas that is interactive for x amount of users. A user's drawing would appear on all other user's canvas(Pages)
- Rules of the Game: 
  - We have a button that when clicked picks a random object to draw, which has random premade objects to draw (e.g. a cat sitting on a windowsill). There is also a button to remove the canvas drawing.
  - The user would draw the image that is shown. An example is shown below: 
  - <img width="1509" height="748" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33e51549-9456-40ff-a8ce-cc56c4e543df" />
